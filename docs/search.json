    "text": "2 About Me:\nHello, I’m Melih. I am currently working as a business analyst at Rimteks. I am carrying out a transformation project within the company. On the other hand, I create business continuity plans and follow workflows. We frequently use data sets when schematizing process plans and taking action. In these days when data sets are as valuable as gold for organizations, I aim to improve myself in making data sets useful and get involved in possible job positions. I believe that acting in the light of data science is the most reliable and definitive way.\nMy Linkedin Account\nRichard Vogg | Examples of simulated datasets that bring value to a data-driven company | RStudio\nIn this presentation, Richard Vogg talks about how he got help from business partners to use advanced techniques and what can be done to make a data project involving several teams more efficient. He states that what is required for these is that discrete independent operations on data sets can be made more effective when combined and that all tables are related on the way to the final table. He likens this plan to the small melodies in the choir aligning and combining to create a single, loud melody.\nIn addition, Richard Vogg mentions that a good data generator has the ability to create appropriate data quickly and efficiently, and states that R has many functions and packages that help simulate independent variables and create them in a meaningful way. In other words, it is said that R has the necessary instruments for the single, high melody in the chorus.\nThis data set includes chemical analysis results of wines belonging to three different classes. It is used to understand classification algorithms or learn data analysis techniques. A 13-dimensional dataset. Additionally, this dataset can also be used to apply classification or regression algorithms, perform data visualization, and evaluate model performance.\nWine Dataset"
