    "text": "2 About Me:\nHello, I’m Melih. I am currently working as a business analyst at Rimteks. I am carrying out a transformation project within the company. On the other hand, I create business continuity plans and follow workflows. We frequently use data sets when schematizing process plans and taking action. In these days when data sets are as valuable as gold for organizations, I aim to improve myself in making data sets useful and get involved in possible job positions. I believe that acting in the light of data science is the most reliable and definitive way.\nMy Linkedin Account\nRichard Vogg | Examples of simulated datasets that bring value to a data-driven company | RStudio\nIn this presentation, Richard Vogg talks about how he got help from business partners to use advanced techniques and what can be done to make a data project involving several teams more efficient. He states that what is required for these is that discrete independent operations on data sets can be made more effective when combined and that all tables are related on the way to the final table. He likens this plan to the small melodies in the choir aligning and combining to create a single, loud melody.\nIn addition, Richard Vogg mentions that a good data generator has the ability to create appropriate data quickly and efficiently, and states that R has many functions and packages that help simulate independent variables and create them in a meaningful way. In other words, it is said that R has the necessary instruments for the single, high melody in the chorus.\nThis data set includes chemical analysis results of wines belonging to three different classes. It is used to understand classification algorithms or learn data analysis techniques. A 13-dimensional dataset. Additionally, this dataset can also be used to apply classification or regression algorithms, perform data visualization, and evaluate model performance.\nWine Dataset"

Phenols encompass many components naturally found in plants. Flavonoids, specifically those found in grape skins during the wine production process, contribute color and character to the wine. In the wine industry, particularly in grapes and the wine production process, phenolic and flavonoid components play a significant role. As seen in the graph, the quality of the wine class increases as the values of phenols and flavonoids rise.\n\nggplot(wine_data, aes(x = factor(Wine), y = Hue, fill = factor(Wine))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Bar Chart: Hue by Wine\",\n       x = \"Wine\",\n       y = \"Hue\",\n       fill = \"Wine\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nHue (Color Tone): It is a measure indicating the color tone of wine, commonly used for red wines, evaluating whether the wine exhibits hues of blue, purple, orange, or red. The color tone can vary depending on factors such as grape variety, ripeness level, and fermentation process. As seen from the graph, wines of good quality tend to have high Hue values"

    "text": "5.1 Designing Cutting Processes with MathCutting\n\n5.1.1 Business Case:\nKaneka is a chemical manufacturing giant that produces Polyimide films. Polyimide film is a material widely used in smartphones and tablets, and Kaneka is a company with a product range of different polyimide film qualities. It produces for a highly variable market. This variability requires quick and effective response to customer demands. To plan this process effectively, Kaneka required an agile, automated production planning process to increase the efficiency of its production operations, ensure on-time delivery of goods, and effectively manage inventory levels and production bottlenecks.\nPlease click here to explore Designing Cutting Processes with MathCutting.\n\n\n5.1.2 Problem:\nHaving gone through the basic production processes, Polyimide film comes to the cutting process, which is one of the important parts of production. This is a bespoke process where film is cut to the required width and length and turned into products specifically tailored to specific customers. For the planning team at Kaneka’s Shiga Factory, selecting materials, deciding on production sequences, and determining how and in what order the cutting would be performed was a long and complex manual process. This reduced productivity. For Kaneka, which was producing in a changing market, it made it difficult to respond to customers and also affected inventory management. For this problem, the production planning team needed an optimum, automatic production planning.\n\n\n5.1.3 How did MathCutting become a solution for Kaneka?\nIn order to increase the efficiency of the cutting process, Kaneka decided to apply the MathCutting mathematical optimization solution in the polyimide film production section of the Shiga Factory. This AI technology has fundamentally transformed the company’s processes and practices and helped drive greater efficiency and optimization across the organizational structure.\nWith MathCutting;\n\nIt can create the most appropriate production and cutting plans quickly and automatically, saving the planning team from manual planning. It gives the team time to focus on different initiatives.\nIt provides significant improvements in data usage, delivery performance and workforce productivity.\nIt enables faster planning of the cutting process.\nIt creates special cutting plans that enable more precise use of materials (savings).\n\n\n\n5.1.4 The future importance of optimization for organizations:\nIn the developing world, companies need to benefit from artificial intelligence technologies to automate and optimize production planning and manage production operations; Optimization provides organizations with the opportunity to manage constant fluctuations in demand, problems in production processes, and customer satisfaction better than your competitors. As we saw in the Kaneka example, the organization achieved significant business benefits by using state-of-the-art mathematical optimization technologies to ensure optimal production planning and facility control. It enables businesses to make data-based decisions and increase the efficiency of their processes. These solution alternatives are created by AI and become available through human interpretation."
